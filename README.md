# Pet-Project---Block-Chain-AZ

## Description

Projects created as a part of the [Block-Chain A-Z](https://www.udemy.com/build-your-blockchain-az/) course given by Kirill Eremenko and Hadelin de Ponteves.

I am taking this course to get a deeper understanding of Blockchains, how they are written and what are some applications that can be done with it.

## File Descriptions
* My-First-Blockchain.ipynb - A simple blockchain
* Python-Class-Notes.ipynb - Q quick refresher on how the python `class` works
